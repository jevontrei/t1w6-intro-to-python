# Intro to Python

## Programming Language

- A language that writes programs for computers.

## Program

- Set of instructions that computers know how to execute.
- Converts programming language commands/instructions in machine languages.

## Datatypes

- Different data
- Depends on the programming language
- Integers (1, 2, 3, 0, -5, 12312, ...)
- Floats (3.5, -4.12, .7, .124124)
- Strings ("Hello", "123456", "", ...)
- Booleans (True & False, 1 & 0)

The others are "non-primitive" datatypes.

## Variables

- Container for our piece of data
- Whenever we want that data, we can use the variable
- Change the variable value as we want
